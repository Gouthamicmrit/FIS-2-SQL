Views : Are virtual tables where only the view definitions are stored as a part of the schema. They do not carry any data. Hence there is no need for space

-All theoritically updatable views are not proactically updatabale.
-We can perform DML operation on views with single base table, provided the column/s not included in the view can take either null/defaults

Purpose of Views : Enhancing query operations with no need to write the queries agaian and again
For Security Purpose

Similarities between isnull() and coalesce()
1. Both are used to evaluate expressions/columns/variables for null and provide
  a default value as a replacement
2. both return null if all value/s are null
    (for coalesce to return null, we may have to pass a datatype without value
       else it throws error)
3. Both can work with all datatypes

Differences 
1. Coalesce is ANSI compatible and can be used in other SQL Platforms, where as
  isnull() cannot
2. isnull() can take only 2 inputs as against coalesce that can take many inputs
